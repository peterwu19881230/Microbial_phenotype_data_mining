Goal: 

```{r ,tidy=TRUE}
#1. Use the original hclust tree 
## Barplot of (fraction-randomFraction)/randomFraction
percentIncrease=(pcomplexBottomUpExp$`Avg Fraction`-pcomplexBottomUpExp$randomFraction)/(pcomplexBottomUpExp$randomFraction)*100
sort.percentIncrease=sort(percentIncrease,decreasing = T)
barplot(main="Fraction from Bottom to top - protein complex annotations\n - original hclust tree",sort.percentIncrease,ylab="Percent increase in fraction",xlab="Different protein complexes (total No.=196)")

## ~22% of 196 protein complexes show increase in the fraction value => They are more clustered than random
sum(percentIncrease>0)/length(percentIncrease) # 0.2244898


#2. Use tree generated by only genes in the 196 protein complexes
## Barplot of (fraction-randomFraction)/randomFraction
percentIncrease=(pcomplexOnly.pcomplexBottomUpExp$`Avg Fraction`-pcomplexOnly.pcomplexBottomUpExp$randomFraction)/(pcomplexOnly.pcomplexBottomUpExp$randomFraction)*100
sort.percentIncrease=sort(percentIncrease,decreasing = T)
barplot(main="Fraction from Bottom to top - protein complex annotations\n - tree of genes in 196 protein complexes",sort.percentIncrease,ylab="Percent increase in fraction",xlab="Different protein complexes (total No.=196)")

## ~30% of 196 pprotein complexes show increase in the fraction value => They are more clustered than random
sum(percentIncrease>0)/length(percentIncrease) # 0.3010204



#3. Use the tree generated by the conditions that are least correlated (Abs() of pcc was taken. 10 pairs of pcc were used)
## Barplot of (fraction-randomFraction)/randomFraction
percentIncrease=(least10pcc.pcomplexBottomUpExp$`Avg Fraction`-least10pcc.pcomplexBottomUpExp$randomFraction)/(least10pcc.pcomplexBottomUpExp$randomFraction)*100
sort.percentIncrease=sort(percentIncrease,decreasing = T)
barplot(main="Fraction from Bottom to top - protein complex annotations\n tree by 10 least correlated condition pair",sort.percentIncrease,ylab="Percent increase in fraction",xlab="Different protein complexes (total No.=196)")

## ~9% of 196 protein complexes show increase in the fraction value => They are more clustered than random
sum(percentIncrease>0)/length(percentIncrease) # 0.09183673
