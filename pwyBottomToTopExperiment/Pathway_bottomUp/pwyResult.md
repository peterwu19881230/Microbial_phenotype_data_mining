# Conclusion: The result from original hclust tree doesn't seem to be very
# good from our quick glimpse. But more detailed discussion is needed to
# verify. The result from figS1's geneID hclust tree doesn't seem to be very
# good from our quick glimpse. But more detailed discussion is needed to
# verify.
