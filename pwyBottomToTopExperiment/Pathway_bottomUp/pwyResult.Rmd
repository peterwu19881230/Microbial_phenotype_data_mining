Goal: 

```{r ,tidy=TRUE}
#1. Use the original hclust tree 
## Barplot of (fraction-randomFraction)/randomFraction
percentIncrease=(auto.pwyBottomUpExp$`Avg Fraction`-auto.pwyBottomUpExp$randomFraction)/(auto.pwyBottomUpExp$randomFraction)*100
sort.percentIncrease=sort(percentIncrease,decreasing = T)
barplot(main="Fraction from Bottom to top - pwy annotations -original hclust tree",sort.percentIncrease,ylab="Percent increase in fraction",xlab="Different pathways (total No.=290)")

## ~41% of 290 pathways show increase in the fraction value => They are more clustered than random
sum(percentIncrease>0)/length(percentIncrease) # 0.4068966



#2. Use tree generated by gene ids in fig S1
## Barplot of (fraction-randomFraction)/fraction 
percentIncrease=(figS1genes.pwyBottomUpExp$`Avg Fraction`-figS1genes.pwyBottomUpExp$randomFraction)/(figS1genes.pwyBottomUpExp$randomFraction)*100
sort.percentIncrease=sort(percentIncrease,decreasing = T)

barplot(main="Fraction from Bottom to top - pwy annotations-tree by genes in fig.S1",sort.percentIncrease,ylab="Percent increase in fraction",xlab="Different pathways (total No.=290)")

## ~53% of 290 pathways show increase in the fraction value => They are more clustered than random
sum(percentIncrease>0)/length(percentIncrease) # 0.5344828



#3. Use the tree generated by the conditions that are least correlated (Abs() of pcc was taken. 10 pairs of pcc were used)
percentIncrease=(least10pcc.pwyBottomUpExp$`Avg Fraction`-least10pcc.pwyBottomUpExp$randomFraction)/(least10pcc.pwyBottomUpExp$randomFraction)*100
sort.percentIncrease=sort(percentIncrease,decreasing = T)

barplot(main="Fraction from Bottom to top - pwy annotations-tree by 10 least \ncorrelated condition pair",sort.percentIncrease,ylab="Percent increase in fraction",xlab="Different pathways (total No.=290)")

## ~22% of 290 pathways show increase in the fraction value => They are more clustered than random
sum(percentIncrease>0)/length(percentIncrease) # 0.2206897



# Conclusion: 
##The result from original hclust tree doesn't seem to be very good from our quick glimpse. But more detailed discussion is needed to verify.
##The result from figS1's geneID hclust tree doesn't seem to be very good from our quick glimpse. But more detailed discussion is needed to verify.
##The result from least10Pcc hclust tree doesn't seem to be very good from our quick glimpse. But more detailed discussion is needed to verify.
