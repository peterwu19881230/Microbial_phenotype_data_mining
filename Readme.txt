#Nichols' Data mining is one of the core projects to develop the statistical application of OMP

*All txt, tsv, csv, .RData... are in the Data folder. Commonly used objects are in the sourced folder. The corresponding .rdx and .rdb files (for lazy loading) will be created from the .RData file by Nichols_preload.R if they don't exist yet.
**If a .RData file needs to be remade, the corresponding .rdx and .rdb files should also be regenerated


*Nichols_preload.R is the file that loads some important stuff for the project (Dataset , functions and important objects I created)

*usedLibraries.R loads the libraries I use often

*The objects I defined:
All_Data: The obj abtained by reading allData.csv (the file where row names haven't been fixed. This is the original file provided by Nichols')

All_Data_NAimputed: NAs in All_Data imputed with mean of All_Data

Binary_Data: The obj that is converted from All_Data where (<-3,>-3 & <3, >3) becomes (-1, 0, 1)

Ternary_Data_NAnotimputed: by All_Data from threshold |fitness|>=3.463

Ternary_Data: converted by All_Data_NAimputed from threshold |fitness|>=3.463

Ternary_Data_324cutff: Ternary data using 324 cutoffs of each condition

Ternary_Data_324cutff_NAremoved: NAs removed from Ternary data using 324 cutoffs of each condition

Ternary_Data_324cutff_condCollapsed: Ternary data of 114 collapsed conditions (NAs are removed during the process of collapsing)

ternary_Price: ternary version of the Price's fitness scores based on their suggested cutoffs: |fitness|>0.5 and |combined t|>4

cor_strains: This is the object generated by taking correlation coefficient from New.All obj

sort.pcc.sql: Transformed from cor_strains. It has the format of a SQL table
sort.pcc.sql.NoIdent: Same obj as sort.pcc.sql but has pcc where 2 strains are the same removed


ECK_1st_table:
ids-Original Name  -  sortedECK_missing_gene_names_added -  associated_gene_names  -  EcoCycID  -  other.synonyms

idsPathways:
ids - EcoCycID - "ACCESSION-2 -" - "ACCESSION-1 -" -  PathwayID - PathwayName

ECK.Pathway_table:
ids - ................ -  PathwayName

ECK.Pathway
ids  -  Data (NA for things not in any pathway)  -  Data Type

ECK.UniProt
ids  -  Data  -  Data Type


s1.pwy: The names for 299 pathways used in figS1 in Nichols'

ids.originalName.pcomplex: the dataframe that contains id in Nichols'-Original strain name-pcomplex annotation

id_allAttributes: All strain info

strain1strain2_allAnnotations_allDistances: All pairwise strain info. (Be aware that some of the columns are distances, not correlation)


*The functions I defined in functions.R

For the bottom-up experiment that traverses the hierarchical clustering tree structure, these functions are required:
elements.hclust(): This is the first function defined without requirement of any self-defined function
fractionBottomUp(): This function requires the above function: elements.hclust()
noOfElementsBottomUp(): This function requires the above function: elements.hclust()
bottomUpExp(): This function requires 2 functions: fractionBottomUp(), noOfElementsBottomUp()
